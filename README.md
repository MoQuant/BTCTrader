# Bitcoin Algorithmic Trading System :iphone: :computer:

## :no_entry: DO NOT USE THIS TO TRADE AS THIS SYSTEM IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES! :no_entry:

### Description
I built this trading program using Python and React.js and I uploaded it to the cloud where it ran well with 
no issues until I shut it down. The strategy I used is an autocorrelation on volatility strategy, similar to
the kappa parameter in the Heston Model.
